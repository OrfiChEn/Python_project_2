# Python_project_2
A  program with python to estimate biochemical reation rate


## Overview

Biochemical reactions are influenced by various factors such as substrate concentration, temperature, and enzyme activity. This project provides a computational framework to:

- Analyze the relationship between input parameters and reaction rate.
- Perform calculations to estimate reaction kinetics.
- Visualize the results for better understanding.

## Features

- **Dynamic Parameter Input:** Easily input reaction-specific parameters such as concentration and temperature.
- **Interactive Graphs:** Visualize reaction rate trends using Pythonâ€™s plotting libraries.
- **Customizable Code:** Modify and extend the calculations for more complex scenarios.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Step-by-step explanations in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the interactive notebook.
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` (can be installed using pip).

## Installation
